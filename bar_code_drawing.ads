package Bar_Code_Drawing is
   type Drawing_Info (<>) is tagged private;
   -- Information about a drawing area, used by a What.*.Draw procedure to draw a bar code, and a How.* package operation to
   -- represent the resulting bar code in the appropriate way

   type Dimension_Number is range 1 .. 2; -- Indicates a 1- or 2-D barcode

   function New_Info (Width : in Positive; Height : in Positive; Dimensions : in Dimension_Number) return Drawing_Info;
   -- Returns a drawing area of Width x Height modules
   -- Dimensions indicates the type of barcode that will be drawn using the result
   -- Initially represents an all-white drawing area

   -- How to use a Drawing_Info object, once declared and initialized with New_Info:
   --    Pass the object to a What.*.Draw procedure, along with the Text to encode and any other information needed by the type of
   --    bar code; Draw will update the object to contain a drawing of the bar code
   --    Pass the updated object to a How.* package operation to convert the drawing into the appropriate representation
   -- For example,
   --    Declare a square Drawing_Info object for a 2-D barcode, sized using What.QR_Code.Width for the text to encode
   --    Pass it to What.QR_Code.Draw with the text to draw a QR code encoding the text in the object
   --    Pass the object to How.PBM.Image to convert the drawing to a String containing the contents of a PBM file
   --    Write the String from Image to a text file to create a PBM file of the QR code
   -- Call How.Ada_GUI.Render to draw the QR code in an Ada-GUI Graphic_Area instead
   -- Use a wide, rectangular, 1-D drawing area and What.Code_128.Draw to create a Code-128 bar code in either or both
   -- representations instead
   -- To add a new representation, create a How.* package with the appropriate operation
   -- To add a new bar-code type, create a What.* package with an appropriate Draw procedure

   procedure Reset (Info : in out Drawing_Info);
   -- Resets Info to all white to reuse it for another bar code

   function Width (Info : in Drawing_Info) return Positive;
   -- Returns the Width value supplied to New_Info

   function Height (Info : in Drawing_Info) return Positive;
   -- Returns the Height value supplied to New_Info

   function Dimensions (Info : in Drawing_Info) return Dimension_Number;
   -- Returns the Dimensions value supplied to New_Info

   -- A module is a black line for a 1D bar code, or a black square for a 2D bar code

   -- This may be processed into an appropriate output format; the verious How.* do this for some possible formats
